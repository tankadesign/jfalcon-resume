        <h2 class="intro">Who do I think I am?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a self-taught full stack web and app developer with 25 years of experience, primarily as a frontend
          developer doing direct-to-client or agency work. I have built and run three small businesses over that time
          and have maintained years long business relationships with clients across the entertainment, beauty and tech
          industries. I am a consummate self-starter with a tireless work ethic which has allowed me to keep working
          through referrals for my entire career. After having spent a few years committed to building a startup that
          raised over $1M in funding I am looking for new opportunities to continue utilizing my various talents and
          experience. Although most of my work is web & app development, I have occasionally taken on creative work in
          video, motion graphics, 3D rendering, and music composition.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a creative developer I have a strong sense of design and attention to detail, making me a good 2nd pair of
          eyes for catching design issues. In a previous life I worked in recording studios as an engineer specializing
          in ProTools and Logic when they were becoming industry standards.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tools">What are my tools?</h2>
        <p>
          As a full-stack developer Iâ€™m mostly using vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML & CSS, Dart/Flutter, Svelte,
          React, React Native, Electron, Swift (UIKit), Firebase, Wordpress, PHP, and various SQL and NoSQL databases.
          In the olden days (pre-2010) I was mainly a Flash/ActionScript interactive media developer and built desktop
          and mobile apps using Adobe Air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I use VScode and Xcode for development. On the creative side I use Cinema 4D, After Effects, Figma,
          Logic Audio, and Reason.
